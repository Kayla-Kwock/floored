# Floored

Floored is a wave-based survival game inspired by the various flash games from the early 2000's. The game plays like a tower defense but with a twist: the enemies can spawn on any one of 5 available floors. Along with upgradable stationary turrets and traps to defend each floor, the player can traverse between them and support any floor using their own weapons. Can you survive?
